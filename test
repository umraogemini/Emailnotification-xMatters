Hi Tao,

The first issue is resolved, but when I checked the second issue, nothing was found. Do you have any idea why this might be happening?

Also, before checking the second issue, could you please verify the following conditions?

1. Ensure that xmatters_auth_token is correctly stored in the secret manager. (1/29 IA...)


2. Confirm that the IAM permissions (roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor) are correctly assigned. (1/24)


3. Check whether var.xmatters_webhook_url is publicly accessible.



Let me know what you find!
