Hi Tao,

The first issue is resolved, but when I checked the second issue, nothing was found. Do you have any idea why this might be happening?

Also, before checking the second issue, could you please verify the following conditions?

1. Ensure that xmatters_auth_token is correctly stored in the secret manager. (1/29 IA...)


2. Confirm that the IAM permissions (roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor) are correctly assigned. (1/24)


3. Check whether var.xmatters_webhook_url is publicly accessible.



Let me know what you find!

Story Points While Setting Up Grafana on GCP
1️⃣ Provisioning Infrastructure

Setting up Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Terraform
Choosing the right node size & autoscaling strategy
Ensuring proper IAM roles for Terraform execution
2️⃣ Deploying Prometheus for Monitoring

Using Helm charts for easy deployment
Configuring persistent storage for metrics retention
Exposing Prometheus outside the cluster securely
3️⃣ Deploying Grafana for Visualization

Installing Grafana using Helm
Setting up persistence for dashboards
Configuring admin credentials securely
4️⃣ Connecting Grafana to Prometheus

Adding Prometheus as a data source in Grafana
Verifying metric ingestion & querying with PromQL
Building custom dashboards for system monitoring
5️⃣ Securing Grafana Access

Enabling authentication (Google OAuth, LDAP, etc.)
Restricting external access using Ingress & firewall rules
Configuring role-based access control (RBAC)
6️⃣ Alerting & Notifications Setup

Setting up alerts based on Prometheus metrics
Integrating Slack, email, or PagerDuty for notifications
Testing alert rules & thresholds
7️⃣ Optimizing Performance & Scaling

Tuning retention policies for Prometheus
Using Grafana Loki for centralized logging
Enabling Grafana dashboards as code for automation
Challenges Faced During Setup
⚠️ Cluster Authentication Issues

Incorrect GKE IAM permissions for Terraform
Fix: Assign roles/container.admin for Terraform execution
⚠️ Prometheus Storage Limitations

Default ephemeral storage leading to data loss
Fix: Enable persistent volume (PV) in Helm
⚠️ Grafana Admin Login Issues

Helm-generated password getting lost
Fix: Retrieve using
sh
Copy
Edit
kubectl get secret grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode
⚠️ Accessing Grafana from Outside GKE

By default, it runs inside the cluster
Fix: Use Ingress + Google Cloud Load Balancer
⚠️ Grafana Not Showing Metrics

Incorrect Prometheus data source configuration
Fix: Verify Prometheus service URL & enable correct scrape configs
