Key Fixes & Changes
Fixed Resource Types

google_monitoring_notification_channel and google_monitoring_alert_policy had incorrect names (google monitoring notification_channel â†’ google_monitoring_notification_channel).
Changed type = "webhook" to type = "webhook_tokenauth"

Your error was caused because "webhook" is not a valid type, but "webhook_tokenauth" is allowed.
Fixed incorrect syntax (= instead of : in labels)

Used {} for the labels block.
Added sensitive_labels for authentication

Used auth_token in sensitive_labels as required for webhook_tokenauth.
Fixed google_monitoring_alert_policy syntax

Used proper condition_threshold block.
Enclosed filter in <<EOT ... EOT for proper handling.
Corrected threshold_value instead of threshold value.
Fixed notification_channels placement

It should be outside the conditions block.
